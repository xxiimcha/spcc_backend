## Database Requirements

### Required Tables (YOUR ACTUAL DATABASE)

- `sections` - Section information (with `room_ids` TEXT field)
- `rooms` - Room information
- `professors` - Professor information
- `subjects` - Subject information
- `schedules` - Schedule records (with JSON days column)

### Key Relationships

- Sections store assigned room IDs in `room_ids` field as comma-separated string
- Schedules reference sections, professors, subjects, and rooms
- Time conflicts are checked across all schedule records
- Days are stored as JSON arrays in the schedules table

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Sections table structure
CREATE TABLE sections (
    section_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    section_name VARCHAR(255),
    grade_level ENUM('11', '12'),
    strand VARCHAR(50),
    number_of_students INT,
    room_ids TEXT  -- Comma-separated list of room IDs
);

-- Schedules table structure
CREATE TABLE schedules (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    school_year VARCHAR(50),
    semester VARCHAR(50),
    subj_id INT,
    prof_id INT,
    schedule_type ENUM('Onsite', 'Online'),
    start_time TIME,
    end_time TIME,
    room_id INT,
    section_id INT,
    days JSON  -- Array of day names
);
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Backend Setup ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

```bash
# All PHP files are already in place:
# - get_room_assigned_sections.php
# - get_available_time_slots.php
# - enhanced_conflict_detection.php
# - schedule.php
```

### 2. Database Setup ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

```sql
-- Your database already has the correct structure:
-- sections table has room_ids field
-- schedules table has JSON days column
-- All necessary indexes are created
```

### 3. Frontend Integration

```tsx
// Import the enhanced components
import EnhancedScheduleForm from "@/components/scheduling/EnhancedScheduleForm";
import SystemSettings from "@/components/admin/SystemSettings";
import EnhancedScheduling from "@/pages/EnhancedScheduling";

// Use in your application
<EnhancedScheduling />;
```

## Usage Guide

### For Administrators

#### 1. Setting Up Academic Periods

1. Navigate to System Settings
2. Set current school year and semester
3. Save settings
4. All scheduling will use these periods

#### 2. Managing Room Assignments

1. Ensure sections have assigned rooms in the `room_ids` field
2. Format: `"1,3,5"` for rooms with IDs 1, 3, and 5
3. Only sections with rooms will appear in scheduling

### For Schedulers

#### 1. Creating a Schedule

1. Open the Enhanced Schedule Form
2. Select a section (only room-assigned sections shown)
3. Choose subject and professor
4. Select schedule type (Onsite/Online)
5. Pick days and times
6. System automatically checks for conflicts
7. Review available time slots if needed
8. Submit schedule

#### 2. Handling Conflicts

1. If conflicts are detected, review the conflict dialog
2. See specific conflict details and solutions
3. Choose from alternative time slots
4. Or force create if necessary (admin only)

## Conflict Resolution

### Types of Conflicts

1. **Professor Conflicts**: Professor already has a class at that time
2. **Room Conflicts**: Room is already booked at that time
3. **Section Conflicts**: Section already has a class at that time

### Resolution Options

1. **Select Different Time**: Choose from available time slots
2. **Select Different Professor**: Choose another available professor
3. **Select Different Room**: Choose another available room
4. **Force Override**: Override conflicts (admin only)

## Best Practices

### 1. Room Assignment

- Assign rooms to sections before scheduling
- Use comma-separated format: `"1,3,5"`
- Ensure room capacity matches section size
- Use appropriate room types (Lecture/Laboratory)

### 2. Time Management

- Check available slots before manual time entry
- Use the conflict detection system
- Plan schedules in advance

### 3. Conflict Prevention

- Review conflicts carefully before overriding
- Use alternative time slots when possible
- Communicate schedule changes to affected parties

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No Sections Available

- **Cause**: Sections don't have assigned rooms in `room_ids` field
- **Solution**: Update `room_ids` field with comma-separated room IDs

#### 2. No Available Time Slots

- **Cause**: Heavy scheduling or conflicts
- **Solution**: Check different days or times, or use online scheduling

#### 3. Conflicts Not Detected

- **Cause**: API issues or database problems
- **Solution**: Check API endpoints and database connections

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check database connections
4. Review section-room assignments
5. Test with minimal data

## API Endpoints

### Base URL

```
http://localhost/spcc_database/
```

### Available Endpoints ‚úÖ **ALL WORKING**

- `GET get_room_assigned_sections.php` - Get sections with rooms ‚úÖ
- `POST get_available_time_slots.php` - Get available time slots ‚úÖ
- `POST enhanced_conflict_detection.php` - Check for conflicts ‚úÖ
- `POST schedule.php` - Create schedule ‚úÖ
- `GET professors.php` - Get professors ‚úÖ
- `GET subjects.php` - Get subjects ‚úÖ

## Security Considerations

### 1. Admin Access

- System settings are admin-only
- Force override is admin-only
- Academic period changes require admin privileges

### 2. Data Validation

- All inputs are validated on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- XSS protection with proper output escaping

### 3. Error Handling

- Graceful error handling for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging purposes

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- Indexed columns for faster queries
- Optimized conflict detection queries
- Efficient time slot generation
- `FIND_IN_SET()` for room assignment queries

### 2. Frontend

- Debounced real-time checking
- Cached API responses
- Optimized re-renders

### 3. API ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- Efficient conflict detection algorithms
- Minimal database queries
- Proper error handling

## Testing

    "days": ["monday", "tuesday"],
    "prof_id": "1",
    "section_id": "1"
  }'
```

#### 3. Test Conflict Detection

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/spcc_database/enhanced_conflict_detection.php" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
